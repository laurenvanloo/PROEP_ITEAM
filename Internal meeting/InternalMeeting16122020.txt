- Add the catch error for all kind of responses (API calls)
(Eg: if the user is unauthorized, he should be directed to login/sign up page)

- Extract the address of api so that we can replace it easy with the official address
in the near future 
- The front-end must be more proactive and communicate with the backend team during
